# Federated Learning Emulation and Evaluation Testbed  

![Cover Image](https://oabuhamdan.com/app/static/media/images/fleet.original.jpg)  

## üöÄ Introduction  

The **Federated Learning Emulation and Evaluation Testbed** provides a **highly configurable, extensible, and reproducible environment** for running **federated learning (FL) experiments** under realistic network conditions.  

At its core, the testbed integrates:  
- **[Flower (Flwr)](https://flower.ai/):** a framework-agnostic FL library.  
- **[Containernet](https://containernet.github.io/):** a Docker-based network emulator.  
- **[Hydra](https://hydra.cc/)** (from **Facebook Research**): for unified configuration management.  

Each FL participant runs inside a Docker container, interconnected through an emulated network with precisely controlled characteristics (latency, bandwidth, packet loss, etc.).  
The testbed also supports **background traffic generation** and **link congestion emulation**, enabling more realistic experimental conditions.  

The workflow is **fully orchestrated with Hydra** and YAML-based configuration, making it:  
- üîß Easy to configure.  
- üì¶ Quick to set up with default settings.  
- üìä Rich in metrics (training logs, system logs, and experiment results).  

This bridges the gap between **pure FL simulations** and **real-world deployments**, enabling researchers to jointly evaluate **algorithmic performance** and **network dynamics**.

## ‚ö° Quickstart  

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu 22.04)  
- [Open vSwitch](https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/intro/install/distributions/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Python 3.10+
- Python Venv

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oabuhamdan/fleet.git
cd fleet
````
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Setup (recommended)

Run the provided setup script:

```bash
bash config.sh
```

This script will:

* Create a Python virtual environment (`.venv/`).
* Install Python dependencies.
* Install Containernet with Pip
* Build Docker images required for the testbed.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Setup

If you prefer to configure things manually:  

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**  

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ````

2. **Install Python dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Containernet:**

   Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/containernet/containernet.git
   ```

   Install it inside your virtual environment:

   ```bash
   cd containernet
   pip install .   # make sure your venv is active
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Build Docker images for FLEET:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t fleet-fl -f static/docker/Dockerfile-FL .
   docker build -t fleet-bg -f static/docker/Dockerfile-BG .
   ```

### Running the Default Experiment  

We provide a default configuration file for a quick start.  
> **Note:** Containernet requires `sudo` permissions to run and create the topology.  

```bash
sudo .venv/bin/python main.py
````

This will:

1. Set up the emulated network.
2. Deploy FL participants in Docker containers.
3. Download and partition the dataset.
4. Start Containernet‚Äôs interactive CLI.


#### Starting the Experiment from the CLI

Once inside the CLI, you can start, stop, and manage experiments.
To launch the federated learning workflow:

```bash
containernet> py net.start_experiment()
```

This command will:

1. Ping all FL clients to ensure connectivity.
2. Start the FL training process.

By default, the FL server will stop automatically after completing all configured rounds.


#### Logs and Results

After the run, you‚Äôll find both **FL training logs** and **network logs** stored at:

```
./static/logs/my_experiment-<timestamp>/
```

#### Exiting the CLI  

To exit the CLI and clean up the network, press:  

```
Ctrl + D
```

If at any time **FLEET exits with an error**, you should manually clean up the network before starting it again with:

```
sudo ./venv/bin/mn -c
```
